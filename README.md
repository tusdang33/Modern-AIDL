# Modern Android AIDL

This Android application demonstrates <b>Inter Process Communication (IPC) via Android Interface Definition Language (AIDL)</b> together with the Repository Pattern for clean architecture and separation of concerns.

<i>This is a way to deploy a more advanced system for the project with AIDL to simplify the logic deployment for both client and server.</i>

## Getting Started

1) Build Server app and Client app to device.

2) After booting the Client app, the screen of the Server App will display the status and connection time

3) Both Client apps and Server apps use Connector Lib to easily request and deploy the necessary logic
